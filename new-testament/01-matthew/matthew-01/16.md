## Analysis

Jacob (or Iacob or Yaqob) conceived Joseph (or Ioseph), whom with Mary (or Marie or Maryam), conceived Jesus (or Iesvs or Iesus or Yeshia) who is called Christ (or Christe) (or the Messiah).

So, from this we can infer the following:

- Jacob --> Joseph
- Joseph & Mary --> Jesus Christ
