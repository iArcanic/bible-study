## Analysis

The book of Matthew first starts of by stating the recorded lineage or genealogy of Jesus Christ the Messiah, who was the son of David, who in turn, was the son of Abraham. This will then be followed by a list of the full ancestory.

So currently, we can infer the following:

- Abraham --> David --> Jesus Christ
