## Analysis

After the exile to Babylon, Jeconiah (or Jehoiachin or Jechoniah or Coniah or Jechonias or Jakim or Iakim) conceived Shealtiel (or Salathielor Shelathiel), who conceived Zerubbabel (or Zorobabel or Zerubbabelor Zorubabel).

So, from this we can infer the following:

- Jeconiah --> Shealtiel --> Zerubbabel
