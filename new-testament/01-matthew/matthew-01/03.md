## Analysis

Judah (or Juda or Judas Iudas) and Tamar (or Thamar) conceived Perez (or Pharez or Phares) and Zerah (or Zara or Zarah or zaram). Perez fathered Hezron (or Esrom or Esron), who fathered Ram (or Aram).

So from this, we can infer the following:

- Judah & Tamar --> Perez, Zerah
- Perez --> Hezron --> Ram
