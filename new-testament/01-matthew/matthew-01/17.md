## Analysis

A summary of all the aforementioned generations from Abraham to Jesus Christ.

- 14 from Abraham to David
- 14 from David until the exile to Babylon
- 14 from the exile to birth of Jesus Christ

So 42 generations in total (from Abraham to Jesus Christ).

Some omissions in the lineage, but those are accounted for in the [Old Testament](../../../old-testament).

- Matthew taking people out the genealogy is not a mistake.
  - Symbolic in common Hebrew Literary practice.
  - Ancient genealogies were a way of making theological claims.
    - So readers of Matthew can understand what exactly was done.

Ommissions include:

- Three consecutive kings of Judah are omitted:
  - Ahaziah, Jehoash, and Amaziah.
  - These kings are seen as wicked.
    - Cursed line of Ahab via his daughter Athaliah.
      - From the third and fourth generation.
  - This could have been omitted to achieve the number 14 (of the second set).
- Ommited king Jehoiakim (father of Jeconiah).
  - The translations of Jehoiakim and Jeconiah in Greek are almost similar.
    - Author has therefore combined the two.
  - The exile to Babylon was in the time of Jeconiah.
  - Some see this as a mistake, however, others argue that this is to achieve the number 14 (from David).
- Final group, with 14 generations.
  - If Joshiah's son was Jehoiakim, then Jeconiah can be counted separately after the exile to Babylon.
    - Matthew's original text even had Joseph as the father of Mary.
      - With Mary marrying a man of the same name later on.

The choice for 3 sets of 14 seems deliberate:

- Some suggest that 14 is twice 7 to symbolise perfection and covenant.
- 42 is also the gematria (numerical value) of the name David.
  - In Hebrew, letters are also used as their numbers.
    - David in Hebrew is `×××`.
      - The first character, `×` (dalet) has a numerical value of 4.
      - The middle character, `×` (waw) has a numerical value of 6.
    - Addition leads to `4 + 6 + 4 = 14`, i.e. the numerical value of David.
  - Matthew wanted to highlight `David = 14` to symbolically link David to Jesus.
- Not just numerical adjustments were made.
  - Some letters in some names were also adjusted.
    - Such as Asa and Amon to Asaph (poet of [Psalms](../../../old-testament/19-psalms)).
  - Matthew is purposely laying down hints.

The genealogy detailed in the [Gospel of Matthew](../../01-matthew) seems to be far more complex than in the [Gospel of Luke](../../03-luke/).

- 14 generations from Jeconiah (born 616 B.C.) to Jesus (born between 6 B.C. and 4 B.C.).
  - Average generational gap would be 44 years.
  - [Old Testament](../../../old-testament) had even wider gaps between generations.
  - Matthew does not have any papponymic naming patterns.
    - Children named after their grandfathers (common custom of the time).
    - Matthew has omitted to save time.

Furthermore, there are only 4 women in an all male genealogy (Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba).

- All four are non-Israelites.
  - These women are specifically associated with potential sex scandals.
  - Matthew could have chosen other pure women.
    - Such as Sarah, Rebecca, and Rachel (all matriarchs of Israel).
  - But mentions Canaanites, prostitutes, and Moabites.
    - Symbolic of Israel's sin and failure to uphold the covenant.
  - Matthew wants to highlight how God uses all types of people in His plan.

This genealogy also fulfills a prophecy:

- Bring the blessing of Abraham promised by God.
- Royal son of David all of Israel have been waiting for.
- Other prophets wrote about.
- Psalmists sang about him.
- Matthew reveals this hope in the genealogy.
